# Hello {{ $teamName }}!

Please note this is your reminder that in one week we will have the monthly Member's Meeting.

If you believe your team has anything to report back over the past 4 weeks, please let us know by the SUNDAY before the Member's Meeting. The Member's Meeting is always the first Wednesday of the month.

If we do not hear from you with a round up, there won't be time to discuss any news at the meeting so it will have to be delayed until the month after.

If you've got any questions, please do email us at <trustees@nottinghack.org.uk>, or reply to this email.

Thank you,

Nottinghack Trustees
